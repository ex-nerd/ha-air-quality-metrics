A Home Assistant custom component that calculates precise EPA Air Quality Index
(AQI and NowCast) and Indoor Air Quality (IAQI) values from raw sensor data.

## Features

Local calculation of air quality metrics for either indoor or outdoor sensors,
for a variety of pollutants.

- Indoor Sensors
  - **IAQI**: ATMO produced this scale and formula as a way to produce a rating
    similar to AQI, but for indoor spaces.
    - https://atmotube.com/blog/indoor-air-quality-index-iaqi
- Outdoor Sensors
  - **EPA NowCast AQI**: This is what most people think of when they hear "AQI."
    This "real time" metric still requires valid data from 2 out of the previous
    3 hours, but will produce a reading on the AQI scale much better suited to
    people wanting to know what the air quality is like "right now," whether the
    concern is pollen, smog, or wildire smoke.

    - https://document.airnow.gov/technical-assistance-document-for-the-reporting-of-daily-air-quailty.pdf
  - **EPA AQI**: Intended as a general air quality score spread across an entire day
    (midnight to midnight), the formula used by this integration takes a more
    liberal approach and looks at 24 hour windows to produce a smoother value
    curve.

### Planned Future Additions

Future metrics to be implemented [RSN](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/real_soon_now):

- **PM2.5 AQI**: Add support for NowCast "trend" ratings and humidity-corrected
  realtime numbers:
  - https://document.airnow.gov/airnow-fire-and-smoke-map-questions-and-answers.pdf
  - See existing AirGradient code: https://github.com/MallocArray/airgradient_esphome/blob/main/packages/sensor_pms5003t.yaml
- **CAQI**: This is the European equivalent to the EPA's AQI. The scale and
  formulas are different.
  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_quality_index#CAQI
- **RESET**: This group produces standards and programs related to indoor
  commercial space. They have published information about air quality, but I
  haven't yet had time to see if there is anything that can be added to this
  integration.

Lovelace templates / blueprints:

I'm still trying to figure out how to add either templates or blueprints based
on the gauge card that I use in my own setup:

For now, you can replicate it via something like this:

```yaml
type: gauge
name: "NowCast"
entity: sensor.outdoor_air_quality_nowcast_aqi
needle: true
min: 0
max: 500
segments:
  - from: 0
    color: "#00e400"
  - from: 50
    color: "#ffff00"
  - from: 100
    color: "#ff7e00"
  - from: 150
    color: "#ff0000"
  - from: 200
    color: "#8f3f97"
  - from: 300
    color: "#7e0023"
```

```yaml
type: gauge
name: "IAQI"
entity: sensor.indoor_air_quality_iaqi
needle: true
min: 0
max: 100
segments:
  - from: 0
    color: "#d32758"
  - from: 21
    color: "#ea6445"
  - from: 41
    color: "#fcb35d"
  - from: 61
    color: "#b0c160"
  - from: 81
    color: "#56ceb5"
```

## How can you help?

- Translations! I might use AI to help with some of the code but I don't trust
  translations to be accurate within the contexts that they need to be.
- I have some older AirGradient hardware but nothing with sensors for some of
  the more exotic gasses/particles. I'd love some feedback from anyone who does,
  or recommendations for what hardware I should get so I can run my own tests.
- Know anyone on the Home Assistant core team who can provide insight about
  adding new device classes? It would be great to support:
  - **VOC Index** like from https://esphome.io/components/sensor/sgp4x/
  - **NOx Index** like from https://esphome.io/components/sensor/sgp4x/
  - **Formaldehyde** like from https://esphome.io/components/sensor/sfa30/
    or https://esphome.io/components/sensor/sm300d2/
  - **IAQI**: The existing AQI device class isn't entirely appropriate because AQI
    measures 0–500 with lower numbers representing clean air, whereas IAQI is
    0-100 with higher numbers representing clean air.

## Installation

### Method 1: HACS (Recommended)

1. Open **HACS** in your Home Assistant panel.
2. Click the three dots in the top-right corner and select **Custom repositories**.
3. Paste your repository URL: `https://github.com/ex-nerd/ha-air-quality-metrics`
4. Select **Integration** as the category and click **Add**.
5. Find **Air Quality** in the HACS store, click **Download**, and restart Home Assistant.

### Method 2: Manual Installation

1. Download the latest release source code.
2. Copy the contents of the `custom_components/air_quality_metrics` folder into your Home Assistant's `config/custom_components/air_quality_metrics` directory.
3. Restart Home Assistant.

## Configuration

Once installed, you can configure the integration directly through the Home Assistant user interface:

1. Navigate to **Settings** -> **Devices & Services**.
2. Click **+ Add Integration** in the bottom right corner.
3. Search for **Air Quality** and follow the on-screen configuration flow.
